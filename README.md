This assignment is about writing code to interface with an external REST-based APIs. We could have used almost any external APIs, but for this assignment we chose GitHub because many of its APIs are public and do not require any authorization or API Keys.This simplifies both the use and setup.
develop a function that will interface with GitHub in order to extract and present useful information to your user. The function will communicate using the RESTful services APIs provided by GitHub. The GitHub APIs will allow you to query for information about users, repositories, etc... which can be retrieved using the function, and then be displayed in the application.
